    <p>Born on the 7th of June 2003. I'm 19 years old and live in Khayelitsha.<br>
    I love playing games, playing soccer and listening to music. I don't watch TV and I watch youtube on my phone instead.</p>
    <p>I am an innovative and percerptive person, I  value the sense of freedom and I can't stand feeling controlled. Growing up, I used<br>
    to always the sky was falling, why am I  so differently wired, am I  a martian? What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in? Cause i don't belong in this world.</p>
    <p>I just want people to finally accept and see that somewhere deep down there is a decent human being in me, it just can't be found. So the reason you've been seeing this<br>
     me, is cause this is me now.</p>
